#summary Installation from svn

=Basic Testdrive=

  * First get the latest source:

{{{
svn checkout http://euclid-wm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ euclid-wm-read-only
}}}

  * cd into the trunk directory

  * Compile:
{{{
make clean
make
}}}

  * Install:
{{{
su
make install
suspend
make install_conf

}}}

  * Read the man page *before* trying it out:
{{{
man euclid-wm
}}}

  * Give it a go: Log out and log in using the euclid session. 

=Debugging=
Debugging a window manager poses its own set of problems, here is the best way I've found to do it:

  * Checkout as above

  * Compile with:
{{{
cc -O0 -g -lX11 -oeuclid-wm euclid-wm.c
}}}

  * Start a new virtual terminal (if you are doing this several times, starting the doing this from within the directory where you compiled will save you some typing when you in the next step):
{{{
su
xinit -- :1 vt12
}}}

  * You should be in a new vt with a single xterm. In the xterm, cd to the directory where you compiled. Optionally switch from root. Then 
{{{
screen gdb euclid-wm
}}}

  * Start euclid, within gdm:
{{{
r
}}}

  * Then `<ctrl> + a, d` to detach screen

  * Switch back to the original vt `<ctrl> + <alt> + <F7>`

  * Attach to the screen session:
{{{
screen -r
}}}

  * Go back to vt12 and do what you want to do, `<ctrl + <alt> + <F12>`
